The Pika framework is a content transformation kit. You can use it to make:

- web sites/apps
- documentation sites
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains
- data sets
- plug-in systems for your own apps
- expression evaluators for your own apps, with the ability to navigate the data your app manages and invoke built-in functions that you provide
