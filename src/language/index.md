## Usage

The Origami expression language is used by

- The [Origami CLI](/cli) command-line tool to evaluate command-line arguments. This gives you considerable expressive power to traverse and manipulate files and other types of data from the command line.
- [Formulas](/framework/formulas.html) to define virtual files and other virtual objects by writing formulas. You can also use the same formulas inside of YAML/JSON data files or YAML/JSON front matter to define virtual data values.
- [Templates](/framework/templates.html) to specify the value of dynamic content inside of otherwise boilerplate text like HTML.
