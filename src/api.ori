# The following formulas are used by specific pages that want to inline API
# documentation for specific classes in the Graph Origami core library. The
# first formula defines a shorthand `source` that refers to the Graph Origami
# source in the Node modules tree. The second formula creates a virtual tree of
# API documentation objects for the core library. That formula uses a custom
# transform called `jsApi`, based on the Microsoft TypeScript compiler, which
# parses JavaScript source to extract type information and comments.
