Returns a new [Iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator) object that contains a two-member array of `[key, value]` for each element in the specific node of the tree. This is consistent with the numerous `entries()` methods in JavaScript, such as [Object.entries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries).
