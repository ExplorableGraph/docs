The explorable graph pattern helps you tackle complex development tasks by representing data as asynchronous graphs and viewing your project's final output as the result of graph transformations.

This is a software design pattern that you can build on in performing common development tasks in many contexts, including:

- web sites/apps
- documentation
- data sets
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains

At this level, there is no code library or framework involved; you are writing and maintaining all the code yourself.

This pattern is the bedrock foundation for the entire Graph Origami project. People considering using the higher-level parts of Graph Origami, such as the [framework](/framework) or [command-line interface](/cli), may find it useful to understand this pattern at this foundational level.

Follow the short intro tutorial to see how to represent and transform data using the explorable graph pattern. The tutorial uses JavaScript and Node.js to illustrate the pattern, but you can apply the pattern in other languages and systems. The primary requirement is that the language supports [asynchronous futures or promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).
