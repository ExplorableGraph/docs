The explorable graph pattern helps you tackle complex development tasks by representing data as asynchronous graphs and viewing your project's final output as the result of graph transformations.

You can use this software design pattern in many contexts, including:

- web sites/apps
- documentation
- data sets
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains

At this level, _there is no code library or framework_, but the pattern itself helps you:

- Apply a higher level of mathematical rigor to your development tasks
- Focus on the logical representation of the data instead of its physical storage and location
- Change how and where data is stored while leaving the rest of your project intact
- Use a consistent model for manipulating one thing or an entire batch of things
- Reuse code between projects
- Leverage the related Graph Origami tools for common operations

This pattern is the bedrock foundation for the entire Graph Origami project. People considering using the higher-level parts of Graph Origami, such as the [framework](/framework) or [command-line interface](/cli), may find it useful to understand this pattern at this foundational level.

Follow the short intro tutorial to see how to represent and transform data using the explorable graph pattern. The tutorial uses JavaScript and Node.js to illustrate the pattern, but you can apply the pattern in other languages and systems. The primary requirement is that the language supports [asynchronous futures or promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).
