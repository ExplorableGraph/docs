You can do this tutorial in two ways:

## Option 1: Web-hosted coding environment

This option doesn't require installing anything on your own computer.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open the [pattern introduction on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/ExplorableGraph/pattern-intro), a hosted development environment. Open StackBlitz in a separate window so you can follow along here.

Note: The default StackBlitz terminal prompt looks like `❯`, but this tutorial uses the more typical `$` as the prompt.

StackBlitz may indicate that you need to enable certain cookies in order to run the server.

## Option 2: Your local coding environment

With this option, you can use whatever code editor you prefer.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Clone the [ExplorableGraph/pattern-intro](https://github.com/ExplorableGraph/pattern-intro) repository to your own machine.

<span class="tutorialStep"></span> Open a terminal window in the project's root directory, then:

```console
$ npm install
```

When running locally, you'll need to invoke this ori tool with `npx ori`. _Throughout the rest of the tutorial, where you see `ori`, you should type `npx ori` instead._
