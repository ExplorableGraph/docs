To transform your team data into an About Us website, you'll write formulas in a small expression language. We'll begin with some "Hello, world" exercises of basic Origami formulas.

## Create a formula

Inside the `src` folder, create a new, empty file with the following _file name_:

```console
message = 'Hello, world!'
```

The file name should be that _entire_ formula, including the `=` sign and the single quotes. Yes, it doesn't look like a normal file name, but it is a valid file name in mainstream operating systems.

The formula in the file name has meaning in the Origami framework.

- The left-hand side of the formula defines the name of a virtual file, `message`.
- The right-hand side is an expression that will be evaluated to determine the value or contents of that virtual file. Here the virtual `message` file will be a text string.
- The file name itself is sufficient to define the behavior. In all the formulas needed for this tutorial, the file itself will be empty. In other situations, the file itself may contain information that can be processed by the formula.

## View the virtual file implied by the formula

Without needing to do anything else, return to the browser window showing your served site, then navigate to and/or refresh the page showing the `src` folder. You should now see a listing that includes:

1. a real file named `team.yaml` that contains the names you entered.
1. a virtual file named `message` that was generated by the above formula. A notation next to that indicates the text "message" indicates the virtual file is generated by a formula.

Click on the `message` link to navigate to a page that says "Hello, world!"

The ori web server is aware of Origami formulas. The server parses file names that contain formulas with an `=` sign and interprets them.

You don't have to use the Origami server: you can integrate the support for formulas into other servers (e.g., [Express](http://expressjs.com/)). Later in this tutorial you'll dispense with a live server altogether by building static files that you can host anywhere.

## Conceptualize real and virtual files as graphs

The Origami framework and the ori command line tool use the same formula language. In addition to viewing the result of a formula in the served site as you did above, at any time you can also view the value of a formula in the command line with the ori tool.

In the terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the running server, then:

```console assert: true
$ ls src
message = 'Hello, world!'  team.yaml
$ ori files/src
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
team.yaml: |
  - name: Alice
  - name: Bob
  - name: Carol
```

(Reminder: if running locally, you'll need to use `npx ori` whenever invoking the ori tool.)

The ori `files` function returns a graph of the two real files in the `src` folder: `team.yaml` and `message = 'Hello, world!'`. It displays the contents of this `files` graph in YAML form.

You can visualize the `files` version of the real `src` folder as graph:

<figure>
  {{ svg files/src }}
  <figcaption>src folder graph has two real files</figcaption>
</figure>

If you ask ori to show the contents of the `virtual` graph based on `src`, it interprets the formulas in file names. The resulting virtual graph includes _both_ the real files and any new virtual files implied by formulas.

```console assert: true
$ ori virtual/src
message: Hello, world!
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
team.yaml: |
  - name: Alice
  - name: Bob
  - name: Carol
```

The `virtual` graph here includes a virtual `message` file whose contents are "Hello, world!". This `virtual` graph looks like:

<figure>
  {{ svg virtual/src }}
  <figcaption>Virtual graph includes the virtual message file</figcaption>
</figure>

The `files` graph above is your starting point: the real files you create by transcribing the ideas and information in your head or collecting data from elsewhere. Through step-by-step transformations, you create a final `virtual` graph that represents the artifact you wish your audience to view or use.

_Transforming graphs is the fundamental operation of the Origami framework._

The ori command-line interface knows how to traverse graphs, so you can ask ori to display a single virtual file from the `virtual` graph on demand:

```console assert: true
$ ori virtual/src/message
Hello, world!
```

In the steps that follow, you will define Origami formulas to dynamically create data and HTML pages. At any point you can view those in the browser, or use ori to view those virtual files in the command line.

Before exploring graph transformations, let's try something else in a formula.

## Invoke a JavaScript function from a formula

In the `src` folder, create a JavaScript file called `greet.js` and paste in the following:

```{{'js'}}
{{ intro/greet.js }}
```

If you don't consider yourself a JavaScript programmer, fear not, it's not necessary to build the final site or required to use Origami. We'll just use it here as just one example of how data might be transformed.

You can use this `greet` formula in an Origami function to generate the contents of a virtual file.

Create a new file and set its name to the entire formula below. (More fun: use your own name instead of "Alice".)

```console
hello.html = greet('Alice')
```

As before, be sure to use single quotes, not double quotes. For cross-platform file name compatibility, Origami doesn't recognize double quotes.

This formula defines a virtual file called `hello.html`. The value or contents of that virtual file will be the result of invoking the function exported by the `greet.js` module. In Origami, this reference to `greet` will be interpreted as a reference to whatever is exported by `greet.js` — in this case, invoking the above function.

You can view the contents of this virtual HTML page in the command line:

```console
$ ori virtual/src/hello.html
Hello, Alice!
```

You can also restart the server to view the virtual page in the served site:

```console
$ ori serve
```

Navigate to the `src` route, which should now show an entry for `hello.html`. If you open that page, you'll see "Hello, Alice!".

Each time you ask for `hello.html`, the web server evaluates the formula. Since the function is regular JavaScript, you can use that JavaScript to create HTML by any means you like. If the function is asynchronous, Origami will `await` the result before serving it to the browser. With that, you should be able to do essentially anything you want in the JavaScript function to create any HTML result.

A function like `greet` here transforms data from one form into another — in this case, it transforms a string name to a string greeting. The function and the formula that invokes it could just as easily transform other kinds of data; there's nothing special about text here.
