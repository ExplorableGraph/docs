To transform our team data into an About Us website, we'll write some formulas in a small expression language. To lay some groundwork, we'll begin with "Hello, world" exercises of basic Origami formulas.

## Create a formula

The Origami framework lets you quickly create virtual files and folders by writing formulas in the file names of real files. These formulas define transformations of real content (text, data) into virtual content.

Inside the `src` folder, create a new, empty file with the following _file name_:

```console
message = 'Hello, world!'
```

The file name should be that _entire_ formula, including the `=` sign and the single quotes. Yes, it doesn't look like a normal file name, but it is a valid file name in mainstream operating systems.

The formula in the file name has meaning in the Origami framework.

- The left-hand side of the formula defines the name of a virtual file, `message`.
- The right-hand side is an expression that will be evaluated to determine the value or contents of that virtual file. Here the virtual `message` file will be a text string.
- The file name itself is sufficient to define the behavior. In all the formulas needed for this tutorial, the file itself will be empty. In other situations, the file itself may contain information that can be processed by the formula.

## View the virtual file implied by the formula

Without needing to do anything else, return to the browser window showing your served site, then navigate to the `src` folder. You should now see a listing that includes:

1. a real file named `team.yaml` with the names you entered.
1. a virtual file named `message` that was generated by the above formula. A notation next to that indicates that the virtual file is being generated by a formula.

If you click on the name of that `message` file, you will navigate to a page that says "Hello, world!"

The ori web server is aware of Origami formulas. The server parses file names that contain formulas with an `=` sign and interprets them.

You don't have to use the Origami server: you can integrate the support for formulas into other servers like [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Later in this tutorial we'll dispense with a live server altogether by building static files that can be hosted anywhere.

## Conceptualizing real and virtual files as graphs

The Origami framework and the ori command line tool use the same formula language. In addition to viewing the result of a formula in the served site as you did above, at any time you can also view the value of a formula in the command line with the ori tool.

In the terminal, press Ctrl+C to stop the running server, then:

```console
$ ls src
message = 'Hello, world!'  team.yaml
$ ori files/src
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
team.yaml: |
  - name: Alice
  - name: Bob
  - name: Carolx
```

The ori `files` function returns a graph of the real files in the `src` folder. The `src` folder contains two real files: `team.yaml` and `message = 'Hello, world!'`. If you ask ori to display the local `files` graph, it will list (in YAML form) the contents of those two files.

You can visualize the `files` version of the `src` folder as graph:

<figure>
  {{ svg root/src }}
</figure>
<figcaption>Source graph containing a single real, empty file</figcaption>

If you ask ori to show the contents of the `virtual` graph based on `src`, it will interpret the formulas in file names. The resulting virtual graph will include _both_ the real files and any new virtual files implied by formulas.

```console
$ ori graphVirtual src
message: Hello, world!
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
team.yaml: |
  - name: Alice
  - name: Bob
  - name: Carol
```

In this case, the `virtual` graph now includes a virtual `message` file whose contents are "Hello, world!". This `virtual` graph looks like:

<figure>
  {{ svg graphVirtual root/src }}
</figure>
<figcaption>Result graph that includes the virtual file generated from the formula</figcaption>

The `files` graph above is your starting point: the real files you create by transcribing the ideas and information in your head or collecting data from elsewhere. Through step-by-step transformations, you create a final `virtual` graph that represents the artifact you wish your audience to view or use.

_Transforming graphs is the fundamental operation of the Origami framework._

Since the ori command-line interface knows how to traverse graphs, you can ask ori to display a single virtual file from the `virtual` graph on demand:

```console assert: true, path: root
$ ori virtual/src/message
Hello, world!
```

In the steps that follow, you will define Origami formulas that dynamically create data and HTML pages. At any point you can view those in the browser, or use ori to view those virtual files in the command line.

We'll come back to graph transformations, but before moving on let's try something else in a formula.

## Invoke a JavaScript function from a formula

In the `src` folder, create a JavaScript file called `greet.js` and paste in the following:

```{{'js'}}
{{ intro/greet.js }}
```

You can use this `greet` formula in an Origami function to generate the contents of a virtual file.

Create a new file and set its name to the entire formula below:

```console
hello.html = greet('world')
```

As before, be sure to use single quotes, not double quotes. (To encourage cross-platform compatibility, Origami doesn't recognize double quotes.)

This will define a virtual file called `hello.html`. The value or contents of that virtual file will be the result of invoking the function exported by the `greet.js` module. Origami follows a convention that `greet` is a reference to whatever is exported by `greet.js` — in this case, a function to invoke.

You can view the contents of this virtual HTML page in the command line:

```console
$ ori virtual/src/hello.html
{{ intro/hello.html }}
```

You can also restart the server to view the virtual page in the served site:

```console
$ ori serve
```

Navigate to the `src` route, which should now show an entry for `hello.html`. If you open that page, you'll see "Hello, world!". Each time you ask for `hello.html`, the web server will evaluate the formula you defined.

Since the function the formula calls is regular JavaScript, you can use that JavaScript to create HTML by any means you like. If the function is asynchronous, Origami will `await` the result before serving it to the browser. With that, you should be able to do essentially anything you want in the JavaScript function to create any HTML result.

A function like `greet` here is essentially transforming a single piece of data from one form (a string) into a different form — HTML intended for presentation. But the function and the formula that invokes it could just as easily be transforming the data into other forms; there's nothing special about HTML here.
