The Origami framework is designed to transform digital content that you can create directly — data, files, and other resources — into forms that can be viewed and used by your audience. It's built on a conceptual paradigm for considering common development tasks that can be translated directly into an efficient [expression language](/language) for describing what you want.

This introduction walks you through the practical example of creating a simple About Us area for a hypothetical organization. To lay the groundwork for that, let's begin with some "Hello, world" exercises of basic Origami features.

## Start

ori copy stuff locally
or launch StackBlitz

## Start a local server

There are a variety of ways to incorporate Origami into an existing web server or a larger project, but for this introduction, you'll use the server built into the companion ori [command-line interface](/cli).

Open a terminal window in the project's root directory, then run the following command:

```console
$ ori serve
Server running at http://localhost:5000
```

You should be able to open http://localhost:5000 and see a listing of the project files. At the moment, all of the files you see are regular files in the file system.

## Create a formula

The Origami framework lets you quickly create virtual files and folders by writing formulas in the file names of real files. These formulas define transformations of real content (text, data) into virtual content.

In a code editor, open the sample project and view the contents of the `hello` folder. This folder is initially empty.

In the `hello` folder, create a new, empty file with the following _name_:

```console
message = 'Hello, world!'
```

The file name should be that _entire_ formula, including the `=` sign and the single quotes. Yes, it doesn't look like a normal file name, but it is a valid file name in mainstream operating systems.

The formula in the file name has meaning in the Origami framework.

- The left-hand side of the formula defines the name of a virtual file, `message`.
- The right-hand side is an expression that will be evaluated to determine the value or contents of that virtual file. Here the virtual `message` file will be a text string.
- The file name itself is sufficient to define the behavior. The file itself can be empty, although it may also contain useful information that can be processed by the formula.

Without needing to do anything else, point your browser at http://localhost:5000/hello. You should now see a listing that includes:

1. the real file named `message = 'Hello, world!'`
1. the virtual file named `message` that was generated by the above formula

If you click on the name of that `message` file, you will navigate to a page called http://localhost:5000/hello/message that says "Hello, world!"

The ori `serve` command you issued earlier is aware of Origami formulas. The server will parse file names that contain formulas with an `=` sign and interpret them.

You don't have to use the Origami server: you can integrate the support for formulas into other servers like [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Later you'll also see how to dispense with a live server entirely by building static files that can be hosted anywhere.

## Conceptualizing real and virtual files as graphs

The Origami framework and the ori command line tool use the same formula language. In addition to viewing the result of a formula in the browser as you did above, at any time you can also view the value of a formula in the command line with the ori tool.

In the terminal, change to the `hello` directory and run these commands:

```console
$ ls
message = 'Hello, world!'
$ ori files
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
```

The ori `files` function returns a graph of the real files in the current folder. The `hello` folder only contains one real file called `message = 'Hello, world!'`. If you ask ori to display the local `files` graph, it will list (in YAML form) the single real file and indicate that it is empty (`""`).

You can visualize the `files` graph as a node (the folder) that points to a single value (an empty file).

<div class="sequence">1</div>

If you ask ori to render the local `app` graph, it interprets any formulas and returns both real and virtual files.

```console
$ ori app
message: Hello, world!
"message = 'Hello, world!'": ""
```

In this case, the `app` graph includes: 1) the virtual `message` file whose contents are "Hello, world!", and 2) the empty real file whose file name implies the creation of the virtual file. This virtual `app` graph looks like:

<div class="sequence">2</div>

![](/figures/appGraph.svg)

This virtual `app` graph was created by transforming the real `files` graph above. During this transformation, the presence of a real file with a formula for its name implied the existence of a virtual file.

_Transforming graphs is the fundamental operation of the Origami framework._

The `files` graph is your starting point: the real files you create by transcribing the ideas and information in your head or gathering data from elsewhere. Through a series of transformations, you create a final virtual graph that represents the artifact you wish your audience to view or use.

Before moving on: since the ori tool knows how to traverse graphs, you can do things like ask ori to display a single virtual file from the `app` graph:

```console
$ ori app/message
Hello, world!
```

In the steps that follow, you will define formulas that dynamically create data and HTML pages. At any point you can view those in the browser, or use ori to view those virtual files in the command line.

We'll come back to graph transformations, but first let's create some more interesting formulas.

## Invoke a JavaScript function from a formula

In the same `hello` folder, creating a JavaScript file called `greet.js` and paste in the following:

```{{'js'}}
{{ samples/framework.yaml/hello/greet.js }}
```

This function generates an HTML fragment that greets a person by name if a name is supplied (or just says "Hello, world!" if no name is given).

You can use this `greet` formula in an Origami function to generate the contents of a virtual file.

As before, create a new file and set its name to the entire formula below:

```console
hello.html = greet()
```

This will define a virtual file called `hello.html`. The value or contents of that virtual file will be the result of invoking the function exported by the `greet.js` module. Origami follows a convention that `greet` is a reference to the whatever is exported by `greet.js`. In this case, that's a function that can be invoked.

If you open http://localhost:5000/hello/hello.html, you'll now see "Hello, **world**!". Each time you ask for `hello.html`, the web server will evaluate the formula you defined.

And as before, you can view the contents of this HTML page in the command line:

```console
$ ori app/hello.html
{{ samples/framework.yaml/hello/hello.html }}
```

## Pass an argument to a function

You can pass arguments to function like `greet`. In the same `hello` folder, create a new file called:

```console
alice.html = greet('Alice')
```

Be sure to use single quotes, not double quotes. To encourage cross-platform compatibility with Microsoft Windows — which does not allow double quotes in file names — Origami doesn't recognize double quotes.

You should now be able to open http://localhost:5000/hello/alice.html to see "Hello, **Alice**!"

Since the function the formula calls is regular JavaScript, you can use that JavaScript to create HTML by any means you like. If the function is asynchronous, Origami will `await` the result before serving it to the browser. With that, you should be able to do essentially anything you want in the JavaScript function to create any HTML result.

A function like `greet` here is essentially transforming a single piece of data from one form (a string) into a different form — HTML intended for presentation. But the function and the formula that invokes it could just as easily be transforming the data into other forms; there's nothing special about HTML here.

## Transform a graph

If you want to create a greeting page for several people, you could create a formula for each of them like the one for `alice.html` above. But you can also write formulas that transform a set of things at once.

Create a new file called `team.yaml` and enter an array of names:

```{{'yaml'}}
{{ samples/framework.yaml/hello/team.yaml }}
```

If you prefer JSON, you can go through this exercise by creating a `team.json` file instead:

```json
{{ samples/framework.yaml/hello/team.json }}
```

Since YAML can be a little easier to read and write by hand (particularly when text needs to span multiple lines), the rest of this introduction will use YAML.

Either way, the data file defines an array. We can visualize that array as a graph:

<div class="sequence">1</div>

![](/figures/arrayGraph.svg)

In Origami, a graph is a first-class data type, so you can transform a graph like this with a formula. Create a new empty file called:

```console
greetings = map(team.yaml, greet)
```

The [map](/cli/builtins.html#map) function is a built-in function that applies a one-to-one map function like `greet` to a graph of object. The result is a new graph of transformed objects. In this case, the `greet` function maps a string to an HTML fragment. Using `map` to apply `greet` to an array of strings will produce a graph of HTML fragments.

If you open http://localhost:5000/hello/, you'll see a new entry for a virtual `greetings` folder. If you click on that `greetings` name, you'll see a list of three links labeled with the indices of the array: "0", "1", "2". Clicking on one of those indices will take you to a page like http://localhost:5001/src/step2/greetings/1, which says "Hello, **Bob**!"

Your `greetings` formula transforms the array in `team.yaml` into a new graph of HTML greetings pages.

<div class="sequence">2</div>

![](/figures/greetingsGraph.svg)

The `map` function, and the graphs used by Origami generally, are _lazy_. They only do work when they need to. Unlike a JavaScript [Array map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), the `map` function here does not do any mapping work upon invocation — it only does the work when someone requests the mapped graph's keys or values. The `greetings` graph represents _potential_ work.

In this case, the HTML greeting for a person like Carol is only generated when you actually try to visit that URL.

Although this graph is essentially flat — it has only level of values, graphs in Origami can be arbitrarily deep. A `map` applied to a deep graph will return a new, deep graph of transformed values.

<div class="two-up">
  <div>
    <div class="sequence">1</div>
    <div>
      <img src="/figures/arrayGraph.svg">
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="sequence">2</div>
    <div>
      <img src="/figures/greetingsGraph.svg">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Transform data into HTML with a template

Transforming data into HTML can be done with plain JavaScript, but for many cases that's overkill.

If all you want to do is pour data into a template, a template language can be more appropriate. Origami comes with built-in support for a minimalist template language called [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com) whose focused feature set complements Origami very well. We'll use Handlebars in this introduction. If you prefer a different template language, you can use it with Origami but doing so is beyond the scope of this intro.

The `step3` folder also contains a Handlebars template called `person.hbs` designed to work with the above data schema. The primary user-visible content of that template is as follows:

... template goes here ..

A template is essentially a function for turning data into a text format like HTML, so Origami allows you to invoke a Handlebars template as a function. All you have to do is give that function data to transform.

In the `step3` folder, create a new, empty file called

```console
alice.html = person.hbs(alice.yaml)
```

This formula creates a virtual file called `alice.html`. The contents of that virtual file will be the HTML obtained by applying the `person.hbs` template to the data in `alice.yaml`. In this case, the primary content of the virtual `alice.html` file will be:

```html
<img
  class="avatar large"
  src="/src/assets/headshots/alice.jpg"
  alt="Alice Wijaya"
/>
<h2 class="name">Alice Wijaya</h2>
<div class="position">Experience Designer, Jakarta</div>
<p class="bio">
  Alice opens the line of communication between clients, customers, and
  businesses to get projects done. With over 15 years in both public and private
  sectors, she has experience in management consultation, team building,
  professional development, strategic implementation, and company collaboration.
  She has a passion for helping people and businesses succeed, and is always
  looking for ways to improve the world.
</p>
```

Open http://localhost:5000/step3/alice.html in your browser to view the result. It will look approximately like this:

![](person.png)

--> graph with one key/value
--> transformed graph

At this point, we're successfully transforming the data for a single person, Alice, to create a single web page for that person.

## Transform an entire graph of data into HTML

It's very common to want to transform an entire set of things to create a new set of things. For this sample About Us area, we want to transform a set of data about team members to create a corresponding set of HTML pages — one page for each person.

In the previous `step3` folder, we had data for a single individual, Alice, stored in a file `alice.yaml`.

In the `step4` folder, you'll find a consolidated data file, `team.yaml`, which contains data for 10 team members.

```yaml
alice:
  id: alice
  name: Alice Wijaya
  location: Jakarta
  position: Experience Designer
  bio: |
    Alice opens the line of communication between clients, customers, and
    businesses to get projects done. With over 15 years in both public and
    private sectors, she has experience in management consultation, team
    building, professional development, strategic implementation, and company
    collaboration. She has a passion for helping people and businesses succeed,
    and is always looking for ways to improve the world.
imani:
  id: imani
  name: Imani Davenhall
  location: Los Angeles
  position: President
  bio:
# ... data continues ...
```

Each block of data for an individual person has a key. The field we use for the key could be anything unique; here we'll use some identifier we've designated as safe to make publicly visible, as it will appear in URLs. At the moment, the key we're using (like `alice`) duplicates the value of the `id` field; we can remove the redundancy later.

We can represent the above data set as a graph:

--> graph

The `step4` folder also contains the same `person.hbs` Handlebars template that can transform the data for a single person into an HTML page for that person. We now want to apply that `person.hbs` template as a function to the entire set of team members.

In the `step4` folder, create a new, empty file called

```console
team = shallowMap(team.yaml, person.hbs)
```

This transforms the above graph of data into a new graph of virtual HTML files:

--> graph

You've now seen the basics of Origami: creating virtual files with formulas, invoking JavaScript from formulas, and using formulas to transform graphs.
