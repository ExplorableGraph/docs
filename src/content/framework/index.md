The Origami framework lets content creators, designers, and developers like you efficiently make:

- web sites/apps
- documentation
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains
- data sets

The basic idea:

- Visualize content creation as the transformations of data in graphs.
- Orchestrate these transformations using Excel-like formulas.
- The formulas transform real data and files into virtual folders and files.
- Turn the virtual folders and files into real ones and publish them.

Follow the short intro tutorial to get a feel for the Origami framework.

The tutorial leads you through the creation of a small website. You can use Origami for many things; site creation is just used here as an illustrative example.
