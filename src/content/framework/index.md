The Origami framework is a set of high-level tools that let you quickly and concisely express the transformation â€” of files, for example.

The framework is intended for content creators and developers willing to read and write formulas written in the Origami expression language. These formulas are comparable to those you might write in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. JavaScript developers should find the framework comfortable to use and easy to extend, but JavaScript knowledge is not a requirement.

The Origami framework is a content transformation kit. You can use it to make:

- web sites/apps
- documentation
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains
- data sets
- plug-in systems for your own apps
- expression evaluators for your own apps, with the ability to navigate the data your app manages and invoke built-in functions that you provide

A good place to start is the [Introduction](intro.html).
