Use the Graph Origami framework to make digital content:

- web sites
- documentation
- data sets
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains

## Concepts

Most tools for creating content like web sites achieve power through complexity that's hidden from you, and offer flexibility through configuration that's to difficult to understand.

The Graph Origami framework gives you a high degree of power and flexibility in a very different way — a foundation of interlocking, fundamental concepts:

1. A **content creation as transformation** model helps you identify: what you want to end up with, what you can start with, and how to transform the starting form into the final result.
1. **Graphs** are a convenient way think about your data, files, and other resources.
1. **Virtual content** represents your intermediate results and your final result.
1. **Metagraphs** are graphs that define their own transformation.
1. **Formulas** transform your real data and files into virtual content you can browse.
1. **Scope** determines the code and data your formulas can reference.
1. **Templates** turn graphs of data into text.
1. **Transforms** change a graph from one form to another, processing content in bulk.
1. **Graph tools** let you directly serve virtual content or copy it to static files for publishing.

Applying these concepts lets you create impressive results with much less work than other systems and maintain control over all aspects of the process.

The implementation of these concepts isn't hidden. If you want to understand things all the way down, you can explore the [programming pattern](/pattern), the [core library](/core), and the [language](language) that support the high-level framework.

Follow the tutorial to build a simple website in Graph Origami and explore each of the above concepts in turn.
