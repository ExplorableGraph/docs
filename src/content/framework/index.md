The Origami framework lets you make:

- web sites/apps
- documentation
- data sets
- command-line tools
- dev toolchains

The basic idea:

- You visualize content creation as the transformations of data in graphs.
- You orchestrate these transformations using Excel-like formulas.
- The formulas transform real data and files into virtual folders and files.
- You can directly browse the virtual folders and files.
- You can turn the virtual folders and files into real ones and publish them.

Follow the short intro tutorial to get a feel for building a small website in the Origami framework.
