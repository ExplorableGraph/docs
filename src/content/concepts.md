title: Graph Origami concepts
---

The Graph Origami system can cover a broad range of situations because it's built from a small number of concepts that get reused and combined in a number of ways. Although the Graph Origami system is quite different than other ways of building software or producing digital content, there are only a few core concepts to learn:

1. [Graphs](graphs.html) for representing data, files, and other resources
1. [Transformations](transformations.html) that convert, say, one type of graph to another
1. [Expressions](expressions.html) for describing transformations
1. [Scope](scope.html) for understanding what you can do or access in a given context

With these basic concepts, you can quickly build a lot of interesting things.
