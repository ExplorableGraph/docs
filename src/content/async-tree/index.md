${ templates/blocks.ori(\_) }

The `async-tree` library lets you work with hierarchical data as a tree whose values may require some time to retrieve.

This library is an implementation of the async tree [pattern](/pattern/), providing definitions for asynchronous trees backed by standard JavaScript classes like `Object` and `Map` and standard browser APIs. The library also includes helper functions for common tree operations.
