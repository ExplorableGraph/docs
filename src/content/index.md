Web Origami is a research project exploring a set of ideas and tools to let you build a wide variety of software artifacts and digital content:

- The [Origami language](/language/) lets you concisely define a website or other structured using formulas similar to those in a spreadsheet.
- The [ori command-line interface](/cli/) (CLI) lets you use Origami expressions in a command terminal to manipulate files or get resources out of an Origami website in the command line. The CLI is also useful as a general tool in its own right for working with JavaScript in the shell.
- The [async-tree library](/async-tree/) lets JavaScript programmers use Origami features in JavaScript applications.
- The [conceptual pattern](/pattern/) at the foundation of it all lets you represent a wide variety of data types as trees that can be easily traversed and transformed. There's no code at this level; you can use the ideas in any project.

Web Origami is intended for designers, developers, and content authors.

## Introduction

## Inspiration

Web Origami takes its name from the traditional paper folding art of origami, in which you can transform a flat square of paper into something like a heart, flower, or animal.

<figure style="align-items: center; display: grid; gap: 2rem; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(125px, 1fr)); justify-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step1.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step2.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step3.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step4.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step5.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step6.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step7.svg">
  <img src="/assets/heart/step8.svg">
</figure>

Every part of the final result is present at the start; the sequence of folds transforms the initial square of paper into the artwork. The steps may be simple but the end result can be complex.

In the same way, Web Origami lets you take content you write and transform it step-by-step into something to share.
