`eg` is a general-purpose command line tool that lets you:

- **use the shell as a basic JavaScript console**, so you can invoke functions, pass arguments and files to functions, and capture function output as files -- all without having to write permanent code. This can be useful when you're experimenting, testing, or need to do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **manipulate hierarchies, graphs, and other data** representable in the [Explorable](/core/explorable.html) graph interface â€” including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.

The hands-on [Intro to eg](intro.html) walks through common uses for `eg`.
