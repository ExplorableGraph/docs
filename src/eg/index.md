`eg` is a general-purpose command line tool that lets you:

- **use the shell as a basic JavaScript console**. You can invoke JavaScript functions, pass arguments (including files or folder trees) to functions, and capture function output as files. You can quickly experiment, test, or do ad hoc operations from the shell.
- **manipulate hierarchies, graphs, and other data** representable in the [Explorable](/core/explorable.html) graph interface â€” including data files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.

The hands-on [Intro to eg](intro.html) walks through common uses for `eg`.
