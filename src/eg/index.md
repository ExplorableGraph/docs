`eg` is a general-purpose command line tool to:

- **bridge the shell and JavaScript**, so you can easily invoke JavaScript from the command line, pass arguments and files to JavaScript functions, and capture function output as files.
- **manipulate hierarchies, graphs, and other data** representable in the [Explorable](/core/explorable.html) graph interface, such as JSON or YAML files, file system folders, JavaScript objects, and web resources.

The [Hands-On Intro](intro.html) walks through common uses for `eg`.
