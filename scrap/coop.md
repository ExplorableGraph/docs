title: Developer co-operative
---

The Web Origami project is a **developer co-operative**.

Only co-op members should use the project for anything beyond tire-kicking experiments and evaluations.

At a minimum, members should:

1. Share their intended use of the project with the other project members. This should be done when you've begun investing any non-trivial effort to use the project. It is not necessary to reveal confidential information, but it is required to share one's general intent.
