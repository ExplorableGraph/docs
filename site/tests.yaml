    When we ask for the keys of this metagraph, we get _three_ keys. Two are the
    keys we defined: `a` and `b = a`. The metagraph also evaluates the formula
    `b = a`, yielding a third, virtual key, `b`.
  actual = keys(fixture): null
  expected:
    - a
    - b
    - b = a
- fixture:
    a: Hello
    b = a: ""
  description: The value of `a` is "Hello", as defined in the original graph.
  actual = fixture/a: null
  expected: Hello
- fixture:
    a: Hello
    b = a: ""
  description: The value of `b` is *also* "Hello", obtained by interpreting the
    formula `b = a`.
  actual = fixture/b: null
  expected: Hello, world!
- fixture:
    a: Hello
    b = a: ""
  description: The complete metagraph looks like
  actual = fixture: null
  expected:
    a: Hello
    b: Hello
    b = a: ""
